# ReactSQpaymentForm

# Square SQPaymentForm refactored to render in React as a component
The form is refactored from the Nodejs example from https://github.com/square/connect-api-examples. The javascript was formatted to fit in a class and some of the html was refactored to jsx. The component works with the server side code and the css from https://github.com/square/connect-api-examples.
